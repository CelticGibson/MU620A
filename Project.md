This code is the implementation of a delay plugin built using the JUCE framework. The plugin provides a flexible stereo delay effect with various features, such as modulation, feedback, filtering, and syncing capabilities. 

<b>Parameters:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b></li>Controls the overall output level.
<li><b>Mix:</b></li> Blends between the dry (unaltered) signal and the wet (delayed) signal.
<li><b>Feedback:</b></li> Adjusts the amount of the delayed signal that is fed back into the delay buffer.
<li><b>Delay Time:</b></li> Sets the delay time in milliseconds or, when sync is enabled, based on musical note divisions.
<li><b>Chorus Depth and Rate:</b></li> Controls the depth and rate of the LFO modulation applied to the delay time, creating a chorus effect.
<li><b>Chorus Mix:</b></li> Balances the mix between the original and modulated (chorus) signals.
<li><b>Ping Pong:</b></li> When enabled, makes the delay alternate between the left and right channels.
<li><b>Sync:</b></li> When enabled, syncs the delay time to the host tempo.
<li><b>Filter Mode:</b></li>Switches between high-pass and low-pass filtering of the delayed signal.
<li><b>Cutoff Frequency:</b></li>Sets the cutoff frequency for the filter applied to the delayed signal.
</ul>

The processBlock method is the core of the plugin's audio processing. It handles the real-time manipulation of the audio buffer, applying the delay effect with modulation and filtering.
